# Fortuitous_Traveler_Coding
My first repository as a hello and please help me along my journey so I may better help yours and others'.

As a child playing on NES and beyond, decided programming video games was my life's dream.
When I reached the age to do so applied to a university and despite being accepted realized the cost was too
much for someone with my financial background, despite educational assistance programs. It was an experience 
to watch gaming universities and programs come into existence and be unable to attend easily without being in 
great debt. When you grow up without much(more than some but less than others), its a defeating experience. 

After missing the "bubble" of gaming being a trend my focus turned to a Computer Science degree from one of, if 
not the first university to ever have a masters available. My thought processes? Video game programming is just 
a watered down Computer Science degree(more focused and specialized in a niche area). So why not have the meat 
and potatoes! Military did not offer me programming despite an ASVAB within 17pts of max achievable score. Tried 
GI Bill but despite completing all tasks on checklist given months before enrollment...the gov failed to send me 
my funds on time and also corresponded any reasons why to my old address instead of my college address on file. 
Halfway through the first semester the gov(VA) still were not paying for my college, sending me earned funds for 
living costs as well as books, and circumstances began to dictate my available path. I dropped out when all I could 
afford was one more cheesy roll up from Taco Bell(89cents). The gov(VA) sent me the checks owed to me for college 
assistance about a month or two after dropping out. The result? A half semester of GI Bill wasted despite doing 
what was required of me per what was identfied by the governing authorities as to be done for chance at a degree.

Worked as security guard at a gas station casino till depression from what felt like being railroaded after years 
of service to country was seemingly treated as moot. Tried to not exist anymore..still here, obviously. Worked in 
oilfield quite unhappily despite decent pay. Burnt out(16-22hr days for 5-6months with maybe 4-6days off the entire 
time[2 days off at a time{day before holiday and the day of..despite worksite being 7-14hrs away for most, which 
meant everbody missed time with family anyway}]). Currently just trying to stay afloat and get back on feet after 
being homeless and other unpleasant experiences. Things are slowly getting better(no sympathy needed, just sharing 
how I ended up here). Have sustained injuries of a nature that, years later, still hurt in varying amounts day to 
day(hoping for full recovery[shoulders&lower back with degenerative discs in cervical{whatever that means..VA doctors 
say its normal but never showed me the X-Rays and instead redirected my questions about my cervical issue to asking 
me about psychiatrics...still never got answers about my cervical and was even sent to local urgent care by the VA 
for an issue the VA has always handled on site and did after forgetting they sent me to urgent care=fiasco}]). 

So, here I am trying to learn on my own without any tuition assistance but many hours of reading about things(propietary, 
open source, licensing, languages, architecture, design, etc). I lack the practical application and practice of experience 
by doing. Am hoping this place is a good start to try and accomplish a lifelong dream held as a child and never given 
chance despite efforts and attempts in the past. Apologies for the long backstory but figured a proper introduction 
includes an origin story of sorts while leaving out all the worst parts reserved only for close kinships & friendships. 
Hope it was a good read and please be kind, I'm tired of fighting and being ugly to those doing so first...and will 
always defend self and those who can not defend themselves. Just need a break and some normalcy while choosing to code 
as an escape from it all.

That being said, I am determined to start with C as my first language after much pondering and research. My interests
are in AI, networking, and any avenues related to curiosities. My weakness is mathematics, which I intend to strengthen 
over time. Have studied 6-7 languages(spoken, not typed programming) in the past 2 years(just basics, on and off). 
Github is a tool in a plan to educate self further without assistance from any source that has failed me in the past 
while avoiding the education through surmounting debt cycle seen before. 

Thank you for this service provided and I hope to one day contribute something of value/worth as show of appreciation. 
All I ask of anyone is to be pleasant and if up to it...help me reach stated goal. Hello and have a great day to you, 
even if just passing through. 

P.S. I have no clue how to navigate Github yet. Learning this is my weekly goal as of now :p

P.S.S. For any interested, am a fresh slab with differing perspective(life experiences and mindset outside the norm).

P.S.S.S. Have experience conforming to(also enforcing), reading, and following SOP/government regulations/international standards/etc
